# loan-approver-app
This application uses machine learning to predict the probability of a customer defaulting on their payments.

This does not replace Underwriting but adds a layer on top to give additional insights in to a customer loan worthiness.

All the customer and client information has been stripped from the code repo and been made to look as generic as possible.

Please contact if you have specific questions about the model, data or any other aspects of this app.

Half a million "approved" applications were used in building the model.

Feature Engineering/Selection was performed on 140+ features to train/validate and test the model.

Crossvalidators (Kfold) were run on multiple models to compare and ROC/AUC parms were carefully considered.
